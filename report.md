# Subsystem Design Report

## Subsystem 1 (MFA)

Multifactor authentication will apply to all users and will aim for a balance between confidentiality and availability.

### First Factor
The first step of authentication will involve a username and password. The username will be stored as a hash. The password will be stored as a hash with salt. The salt for each user will be unique and will be generated upon registration. The salt will be stored as plain text.

### Second Factor
The second factor will be triggered on the completion of the first factor. On passing the first stage a random string will be generated by the server and stored temporarily in the database with the associated user in hash form. An sms will be sent to the user based on the registered phone number with the digits. The user will be redirected to another form to key in the digits. He will have 2 minutes to do so after which the login process will fail and the temporary string will be replaced with nonces. On success, the user will receive a session and be able to login and the string will be replaced with nonces.

### Third factor for special actions
The third factor will be applicable only to administrators. The administrators will have a specially assigned BLE token with a private symmetric??? key. When logging in as an administrator, the token will have to be present and scanned before gaining access to the account on top of the first and second factor.

### Services and tools to be used
GraphQL and PHP for the initial registration. PHP crypto libraries will be used to encrypt the usernames,passwords and other data.

Free SMS service will be used to send the random string for the second factor [Sample free sms service](https://www.textlocal.com/integrations/api/).

SSL certificates will be generated for transferring data between client and server to ensure confidentiality and integrity [Free Signed SSL Certificate Service](https://letsencrypt.org/).

Subsystems 2 to 4 will support the following functionalities with the following parameters:

1. Registration
    1. National Registration Identification Card (NRIC)
    1. Name
    1. Email
    1. Phone
    1. Address
    1. Age
    1. Role

1. Log In
    1. NRIC
    1. Password
    1. Role

A sample POST query looks something like this:

```
{
  "query": "registration",
  "variables": { "ic": "someValue", ... }
}
```

The log in system will be protected with Google reCAPTCHA to prevent brute force attacks to access into the accounts of administrators.

We will use GraphQL to facilitate communication between the Client & the Server. GraphQL is susceptible to:
1. SQL injections & XSS (especially if the input field is a custom type, such as JSON). Therefore, we will need to sanitise user input.
1. Broken Access Controls. GraphQL does not verify whether a user has the permissions to retrieve sensitive data such as the password of the user, etc. Therefore, we will be using Apache Shiro to perform user permissions authentication.

We will also be protecting our system by:
1. Using HTTPS to ensure confidentiality in data transfer between the Client & the Server.
1. Disallowing executables to be uploaded into the database. 
1. Using an anti-virus scanner to scan through image and video files that will be uploaded into the database.

## Subsystem 2 (Interface for Therapists & Patients)
Therapists:
1. Able to list patients under their charge
1. Select patients' records to view but not change
1. Create new records
1. Edit their own created records
1. Print out reports

Patients:
1. Able to view but not change their medical data
1. Able to add/remove authorisation for therapist(s) to view any of their medical data

In addition, admin users are able to:
1. Add users to the system
1. Display logs of all transactions in the system

## Subsystem 3 (Interface for Researchers & Anyone)
This subsystem will support the functionality of retrieving anonymous data (implemented through k-anonymity), which can be filtered by:
1. Location
1. Subtype
1. Age
1. Gender

A sample GET query looks something like this:

```
{
  anonymised_records( "location": "someValue", "subtype": "number of steps per day", ... ) {
    location
    subtype
    gender
    location
    reading
    disease
  }
}
```

The minimum, average and maximum values of `Age` & `Reading` will be automatically generated. Furthermore, with each retrieval, the order of the data will be randomised to make it harder to re-identify each person through piecing different parts of the data.

Below is a sample of the original data:
![pre-anonymised data](https://github.com/IFS4205-2018-Sem1-Team1/design-report/raw/master/images/pre_anonymisation.png)

And the generated data:
![post-anonymised data](https://github.com/IFS4205-2018-Sem1-Team1/design-report/raw/master/images/post_anonymisation.png)

Notice that this data has 2-anonymity with respect to the attributes `Age`, `Gender`, `Location` and `Steps`, but not for the attribute `Disease`.

## Subsystem 4 (Secure Transfer)

## Subsystem 5 (Data Collection from Sensors)
Use Android's accelerometer to track movement activity and upload data to system.
