# design-report

Each team is to produce a subsystem design report, which:
1. Clearly outlines your proposed design for each subsystem.
1. What are you going to implement?
1. How will you do it?
1. For each component you should explain its interfaces, and any controls/checks on its interfaces that you intend to use, and why.
1. What protocols are to be used?
